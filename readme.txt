A Collection of Enhancements to Improve Time Handling on Your Site

== Description == 

This is a compilation of many tweaks to improve your site, including...

1. Date Based Archives will show up from oldest to newest, instead of newest first. When you are scrolling through memory lane, you want to do it in order.
2. Adds the %dayofyear% tag so you can have your permalinks as /%year%/%dayofyear% instead of month and day.
3. Adds On This Day URLs and Widgets /onthisday
4. Adds This Week URLs and Widgets /thisweek
5. Adds /updated, /random, /oldest as top level archives
6. Adds the %week% tag so you can have your permalinks include the year and adds the option for 2021/W21 to indicate Week 21 of the year.


== Installation ==

Install and activate. No configuration by default.

= Why did you create this? =

I realized I was doing a lot of these little enhancements in other places, buried in my other plugins, where they were only tangentially related to what the plugin was for.
So I split all of these time based enhancements into their own thing.
